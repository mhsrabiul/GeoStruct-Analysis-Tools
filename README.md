# GeoStruct-Analysis-Tools

**GeoStruct-Analysis-Tools** is a Python-based toolkit designed for civil and geotechnical engineers. It includes two main tools: 
1. **Soil Classification and Analysis Tool** 
2. **Structural Material Optimization Tool**

These tools help automate soil classification based on various geotechnical properties and optimize material usage in structural designs, ensuring cost-efficiency and safety.

## Features

### 1. Soil Classification and Analysis Tool
- **Input**: Grain size distribution (sieve analysis or hydrometer test), Atterberg limits, and moisture content.
- **Output**: Soil classification according to the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and graphical representation of grain size distribution curves.
- **Use Case**: Helps classify soil into categories such as gravel, sand, silt, and clay.

### 2. Structural Material Optimization Tool
- **Input**: Material properties (e.g., steel or concrete), loads, and initial structural dimensions.
- **Output**: Optimized beam, column, and slab dimensions to minimize material usage while maintaining structural safety. Includes trade-off analysis between cost, safety, and material usage.
- **Use Case**: Helps engineers minimize material usage while adhering to safety standards.
